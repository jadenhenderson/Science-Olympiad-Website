# Instructions for download
After you've downloaded the files, unzip them if necessary, and **make sure they all stay within the same folder**. Don't rename anything. To see the website, simply run index.html by double clicking on it, and it should open up in your default web browser.

## About
This website is being made for the Jenison Science Olympiad team. It is currently in progress, so the version you download might not be the most up-to-date version, and it most likely looks incomplete. Jaden Henderson is doing most of the website design, Boldt is working on the calendar.

## If things look like trash
If the
1. Website lacks color and looks like raw content with no styling
2. Slideshow appears as a bunch of separate pictures, so you see a long list of pictures instead of one at a time
3. Navigation bars look wack and appear vertically, even if you're viewing on a desktop or tablet

It's probably because you haven't set it up correctly. Be sure that you follow the directions in "Instructions for download" and all files are located in the same folder. If things still don't work, ask Jaden Henderson on discord for help.
